Subject: [Ar7-firmware-user] OpenWrt on a Sinus 154 DSL Basic SE: no boot / no telnet access
Message-ID: <1144586003.23640.32.camel@localhost>

Hi there,

I am trying to run OpenWrt on a Sinus 154 DSL Basic SE with your
patches. The recovery system of my router accepts the firmware images
and seems to write them to the flash.

When I use the files, which are directly created from OpenWrt
(openwrt-ar7-2.4-kernel-SINUS_DSL_BASIC_SE.bin and
openwrt-ar7-2.4-squashfs-SINUS_DSL_BASIC_SE.bin), the router seems to
boot something: After about 8 seconds I can ping it, but I don't get
telnet access to it (in fact no TCP port seems to be open).

When I follow the instructions on
http://ar7-firmware.berlios.de/doc/loader and create images using an
original pfs.img (linux-firmware.bin and linux-userinterface.bin), the
router only reboots into the recovery system.


I seem to miss some magic somewhere - so, this is what I tried so far
(maybe we could create an install guide from this):


1. I checkout the revision 2984 of OpenWrt. The patch (svndiff.patch)
applies cleanly to it.

2. I run "make menuconfig" and set "Telnet access" to open.

3. A simple make would fail because of missing header files from
madwifi. So, I checkout revision 1358 of madwifi (same revision OpenWrt
would use, when you activate the madwifi package) and link the directory
to /openwrt/staging_dir_mipsel/usr/include/madwifi

4. I compile the mkfirm tool

5. I run make

6. I extract an original pfs.img from FW_154DSLBasicSE_V1.12.bin using
7z (from p7zip), which can deal with the non-standard zip format.

7. I run the commands from http://ar7-firmware.berlios.de/doc/loader to
create the firmware images.


Alas, with no success so far. I hope you can help out.

Best regards,
Michael

Hi Michael,

did you use the serial interface to your router? It will show a
numeric error code if loading of the firmware image fails.
This error code tells the reason of the failure. But I think
your firmware was working quite well:

My patch for OpenWrt contains the file .config with a working
configuration, so for a first try you don't need to change
anything in "make menuconfig".

You said you can ping the router shortly after reboot and there
are no open ports? This is normal for a system which tries NFS boot.
If you run a network sniffer (ethereal, ...), you should see
ethernet frames coming from the router.

The kernel is configured for NFS boot. It will try to boot from
a NFS server on IP 192.168.2.2. The server must export a router
filesystem /nfsroot. Take the filesystem from your build,
maybe it works (watch with serial port, or at least with ethereal).
If not (still no telnet server running), try to change the init
script /nfsroot/etc/preinit.sinus154. A minimal script might
just mount /proc and exec telnetd.

madwifi is not used for Sinus 154. The patch should have removed
any reference to madwifi, so there should be no need to compile it.
Obviously this failed - I'll have to make a new patch :-)

Good luck,
Stefan

Hi Sebastian,

there was no archive of the list because there were no contributions
from any user. Your entry was the first one, congratulation.
